        In this post, we're going to tackle the similarities and differences between blocks, procs, and lambdas in Ruby. Their names may seem a little intimidating at first, but once you get to know them they're actually quite friendly! :)
      </p>

      <p>
        You may have come across blocks before while working with various Ruby methods. If not, they can be spotted pretty easily. A <b>block</b> is the little bit of code that comes between curly brackets <code>{}</code> or between the keywords <code>do..end</code> after a Ruby method name. The block indicates the behavior a method should perform on the object it's called on. Below is example using the method <code>#map</code>.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/achen116/2198faba7389200e2cc7.js"></script></p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In the example above, the block is <code>|drink| drink + ":venti"</code>. It tells <code>#map</code> to iterate through the <code>starbucks_order</code> array and add the string <code>": venti"</code> to each string item (represented by the parameter <code>drink</code>) in the array. Whether we used the <code>{}</code> or <code>do..end</code> syntax, the output was the same. Now, our Starbucks baristas know what size drink we'd like!
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        So, what if we had a few more Starbucks orders that all wanted to Venti-sized drinks? We could call <code>#map</code> on each of these orders and pass through the same block <code>|drink| drink + ":venti"</code> every time but that would require a lot of repetition. Since blocks are technically not considered Ruby objects, we can't save them to a variable and pass that variable as a block. Instead, we can use <b>procs</b>. A proc is a saved version of a block. The example below demonstrates the use of a proc.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/achen116/bc5bfdd9be77504f9555.js"></script></p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        As you can see, we created a new proc using <code>Proc.new</code> and passed in the block behavior we want to reuse in curly braces (<code>do..end</code> is also acceptable). This proc is saved as the variable <code>venti</code>, which can be passed as a parameter to a method name as seen on line 9, 10, and 11; note that the proc is placed between regular parentheses (), not curly braces {}. The <code>&</code> turns the proc into a usable block. Now, we don't have to rewrite <code>|drink| drink + ":venti"</code> multiple times, we can simply write <code>&venti</code>. Pretty neat, right?
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        <b>Lambdas</b> are very similar to procs. They also save code blocks in variables and their syntax is almost identical - you just exchange <code>Proc.new</code> for <code>lambda</code> - everything else remains the same. You're probably wondering.. what's the catch? Well, the difference between the two concepts is in how they behave inside a calling method. If you use <code>return</code> in a lambda, it will exit its own block and give control back to the calling method. On the other hand, if you use <code>return</code> in a proc, it will exit from its own block and from the entire calling method itself; control is not given back to the calling method.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <p>
        The example above illustrates the return output based on whether the calling method <code>#some_(lambda/proc)_method</code> uses a lambda or a proc. In <code>#some_lambda_method</code>, the code returns the final <code>return</code> statement, while in #some_proc_method, the code returns the inner <code>return</code> statement found inside the proc block because procs don't give control back to the calling method. As a result of this behavior from procs, it is recommended to avoid using them so you don't run into confusion or issues with your return statements. Lambdas provide a great alternative and will also help you keep your Ruby code D.R.Y.

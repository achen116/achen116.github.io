  <h1>Writing Good Questions</h1>
  <h2><!-- subtitle (optional) --></h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      There is no such thing as a dumb question, but... there <i>is</i> a way to write and ask good questions.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The author of the blog post <a href="http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/"><u>Writing the Perfect Question</u></a> discusses "The Golden Rule" of asking coding questions, which is to imagine yourself as the individual trying to answer the question. Once you've finished writing your question, it's important to read it over again not only for typos but also for clarity. Your question should be easy to understand so an individual reading it can easily provide an answer.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Putting yourself in the shoes of this other individual will help you recognize the readability of your question. This piece of advice is applicable to all fields of work. In my previous job, I constantly re-read my emails to ensure my questions (or requests) were clear and provided no gaps for misunderstanding. Not only does this make it simpler for the reader, but it also saves time. Instead of going back and forth asking/answering questions about the question, the responder can provide an answer right off the bat. So, how do you know when your question is crystal clear? Below are a few guidelines.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      First of all, take some time to think about your question's <b>title</b>. The title should not be considered a header; it should be a question that summarizes your bigger question. Formatting your title this way will give the reader an idea of what you need help with before diving into the meat of the text. Not all titles will work as questions, so don't beat yourself silly if it doesn't make sense. Just be sure your title is specific and relates to the context of your question, which is our next topic of discussion.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The <b>context</b> of your question is significant because it's where readers should be able to find the details of your problem. A few key pieces of information to include are:
      <ul>
        <li class="blog">The language or platform you're working in</li>
        <li class="blog">Any constraints</li>
        <li class="blog">A description of your problem, as well as the big picture goal</li>
        <li class="blog">A description of what you've tried</li>
        <li class="blog">A description of your results (i.e. the received output vs expected output, error messages, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing your question, remember to be as detailed as possible and to put yourself in the shoes of your reader. They have zero experience with your code, so it's best to assume they know nothing and provide as many relevant details as possible from the small and big picture goals of your program to the type of error messages you're receiving.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Finally, provide <b>sample code</b>! It is much easier for someone to answer your coding questions and identify the problem when they can actually <i>see</i> the code firsthand. However, don't include your entire program - just include the necessary lines that involve the problem areas of your question. In addition, make sure your code is formatted properly so it is easy on the eyes and easy to review.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      As a novice programmer just learning about these useful tips, I can definitely identify times where I have strayed from these guidelines. For example, I have forgotten to include sample code, and I have probably asked a question that may have not been explained clearly enough, which also means I wasn't putting myself in the shoes of the reader. These slip ups lead to misunderstandings from readers and makes it harder for them to provide an answer, which is ultimately frustrating for everyone. However, practice makes perfect and practicing these tips will help me (and you) write better questions and, as a result, receive better answers.

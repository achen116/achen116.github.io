  <h1>Chef's In The Kitchen</h1>
  <h2>DBC First Impressions and Expectations</h2>

  <section>
        <p>
        Someone pinch me! It is almost the end of Week 1 of Phase 0 in Dev Bootcamp, and I can hardly believe this crazy journey is already under way. I just watched Shereef's Fireside Chat, which has both qualmed some of my nerves and pumped me up even more for this experience. The video discusses DBC's kitchen mindset, which focuses on a team environment and team attitude - basically meaning students and staff are working together and supporting each other throughout these next 18 weeks. This perspective paints a great impression of DBC's mission to truly help individuals of all levels (even novices like myself) learn programming, as well as provide mental and emotional backing throughout the intense program. It's really reassuring to know the type of encouragement DBC promotes and makes me feel more confident about going through the program.

        I also appreciated that the video addressed the different levels of incoming students and different fears everyone may be feeling. Personally, I am honestly nervous about my skillset; I don't have any programming experience aside from what I've learned on my own through online portals, such as Codecademy. The video helped me remind myself I am not alone and should not compare my knowledge to anyone else's. After all, when I decided to make a career switch and attend DBC, I understood it would be not only life-changing but also terribly difficult. I realize the work and effort I put in will ultimately determine the success of my bootcamp experience; simply going through the motions will just not be enough. That being said, I'm super excited to be a part of DBC! Already, the staff and my fellow dragonflies have been very motivational and helpful in just this first week. I'm ready to keep working through DBC's curriculum, learn more than my brain can handle, and get to know some awesome people!

    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h2>What is stereotype threat and how does it affect us?</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        Stereotype threat refers to the risk of being viewed as possessing a negative stereotype as one's own characteristic or the fear of doing something which would confirm the negative stereeotype. This term was first coined by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in 1995 when they performed various studies that indicated stereotype threat can influence one's intellectual performance. In one study they prompted a group of students before a test saying it would measure their intellectual ability. Results from that group revealed that African Americans drastically underperformed when compared to Caucasians. However, when they prompted another group of students before a test saying it would not measure their intellectual ability, African Americans and Caucasians performed equally. In this <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">article</a> referencing Steele's discussion on stereotype threat, it is called "subconscious self-handicappping." Even more, it is explained as "one of the major barriers holding back the achievement of Blacks, women, and other underepresented groups."

        After learning more about imposter syndrome and stereotype threat, I can start to see where these concepts have appeared in my life, especially as a student and post-college grad. In most experiences, I've been afraid of being exposed as an imposter, as someone who is actually not competent in school, not strong enough to withstand a slew of obstacles, and overall just not intelligent <i>enough</i>. I can remember this feeling beginning as early as middle school. I attended a public school district, which was made up of a majority of Asians and was highly competitive. As a result, the standards and expectations of students were very high. I worried that I wouldn't be able to live up to these standards and that I didn't have the inherit skillset to do so. While this self-doubt hindered me at times and made me believe I could not score as high on a test as someone else or wouldn't be as successful as "so and so," I also think it helped motivate me. I didn't want to be viewed as not being smart or not being able to keep up with the material, so I worked even harder to make sure that didn't happen. I guess you could say my fear of being "exposed" is what lit the fire under me. However, I still need to remind myself that the success of my hard work isn't just luck or a result of my fear. I need to continue believing in myself, my true abilities, and my full potential.

        In just three short weeks, I'll be onsite at DBC and these feelings are sure to resurface even stronger. It'll be extremely important to keep believing in myself and know that I'm not alone in this next experience. I hope everyone reading this remembers they're not alone either and have the capacity, intelligence, and perserverence to succeed through whatever obstace they're enduring and achieve their goals :)

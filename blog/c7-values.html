  <h1>Don't Forget Your Values</h1>
  <h2>Discussing my most valued values</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      <b>In general, I try to live up to these values:</b>
      <br/>
      <i>Family / Friendship / Achievement / Meaningful Work / Mentorship / Adventure</i>
    </p>

      Family is my most important value in life, and my family has taught me to try to live up to all the values (and more) mentioned above. They are my biggest cheerleaders, supporting me through all obstacles, small or large, while reminding me not to overwhelm myself with stress. They have helped me achieve some of my proudest accomplishments, such as graduating from college, and encouraged me to chase my craziest dreams, such as becoming a programmer. My family's positive spirit, whether I succeed or fail miserably, is what always motivates me in my personal, educational, and professional life. It will definitely be difficult moving away from them for the duration of DBC, where I'll most likely encounter the toughest 9 weeks of my life yet.

      The last topic someone asked for advice on was about friendship. I'm sure pretty much all of us have heard some version of the age-old saying, "You're only as good as those you surround yourself with," which can also be thought of as meaning <b>surround yourself with positive influences</b>. I do believe in this idea and have learned that your friends can make a strong impact on your mood, behavior, and health. It's significant to staying close to those that contribute happiness to your life and avoiding those that bring negativity. It definitely equates to a happier and healthier you :)

      I believe keeping my values in mind while at DBC will help me endure through the program and combat feelings of imposter syndrome and stereotype threat. They will help remind me of the reasons I'm at DBC and keep me energized in my work. Being a part of and doing meaningful work is one of the main reasons I want to attend DBC and become a programmer. I have always had a passion for helping others; as a programmer, I believe I will have the opportunity to not only do something I enjoy but also discover and create solutions to real problems.

    <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
    <h2>"Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh the thinks you can think up if only you try!" --Dr. Seuss</h2>

        My Gregorc thinking style is "Concrete Sequential" and "Abstract Random" - concrete AND abstract you say? Yup. At first, this combination didn't make much sense to me either - I even took the quiz a second time to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. However, after reading about the two styles, I could begin to pinpoint and understand where my thinking habits overlapped.

        I would definitely consider myself more of a Concrete Sequential thinker. I thrive on organization, structure, and clear directions. I learn best in these types of environments because I can digest concepts and assignments in a way that is understandable to me: in a logical sequence. My mind is jumbled when I'm in an unorganized environment, whether it is at home, school, or work. It simply cannot focus until I am able to sort everything into its correct order.

        On the other hand, Concrete Sequential thinkers are described as having difficulty working in groups and using their imagination, while Abstract Random thinkers are described as enjoying group situations. I believe this is where my overlap occurs. While I do well with structured environments, I still desire a freedom for experimentation and a freedom to exercise one's imagination. After all, imagination and collaboration with multiple individuals fosters new, great ideas. I hope to utilize the Abstract Random thinker in me more as I progress through DBC and spend more time working with my cohort.

        Understanding both the positives and negatives to my thinking styles will help me achieve the best possible learning experience at DBC. Knowing I excel in structured environments will encourage me to not only keep my learning space organized but also my learning methodology. Even more, maintaining a growth mindset throughout this process and being open to new learning and thinking styles will only benefit me as an individual and as a student.

        It is my goal to not only learn programming but also acquire and apply new learning techniques to better my experience at DBC. Currently, my biggest struggle is time-boxing. While I can prioritize my assignments well, I generally end up spending more time on a project than needed. I get carried away with the details and perfecting it when I know it's not always necessary. Incorporating the pomodoro technique as a regular habit will hopefully help me keep track of my time. Usually, an hour will pass before I even know it, which is great in the sense that I'm so involved in my work I'm not paying attention to the clock. However, it can be detrimental if I'm spiraling down a rabbit hole without noticing.

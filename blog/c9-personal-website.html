    <h1>Blank Slate</h1>
    <h2>A reflection on creating my own personal website</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        It's hard to believe that it has been almost two months since Dev Bootcamp introduced me to HTML/CSS. During Week 2 of Phase 0, I was tasked with building my own personal website from a blank slate. I remember being excited and overwhelmed. The possibilities were literally endless, so it was imperative to timebox myself to ensure I didn't get carried away down a rabbit hole. Admittedly, I did spend more time on building my website than I had initially planned on, but I believe one reason I divulged more time in it is I really enjoyed what I was doing. Time seemed to just fly by without me even realizing it. So, when one of the final challenges of Phase 0 was to revisit our website, I was eager to have time set aside to make the modifications I had been meaning to implement over the last few weeks.

        As I sat down to begin working on my website, I felt another wave of anxiety overcome me. There were <i>a lot</i> of changes I could make, a good number of changes I should make, and another variety of changes I wanted to make. The possibilities were, again, endless. I didn't want to overstep my timebox again, so I tried my best to stay focused on a limited number of goals I wanted to accomplish for just this round of adjustments. I started by carrying out the small changes first, such as modifying the header size, removing the "contact" link, and adding a placeholder on my Portfolio page. This way, I could start crossing items off my "to-do" list and slowly peel off layers of stress. Next, I worked on a bigger mission: incorporating my blog post pages into my website. Previously, they stood on their own on a blank white page with no buttons to take you back to the index - it was pretty boring. I not only wanted to add a "back" button, but I also wanted the look and feel of the blog posts to match that of the website. I fiddled around with different possibilities for quite awhile. (Reflecting on it now, I probably should've taken some time to wireframe my thoughts before trying to alter the HTML/CSS). Just as I was about to settle with a so-so layout, I experimented with one more idea, and I'm glad I took that little bit of extra time to achieve the design I actually wanted.

        During this challenge, I learned about how much I enjoy the front-end design process. I would love to get more practice and increase my familiarity with HTML/CSS, as well as learn about different frameworks and how to utilize them appropriately. Even more, the idea that websites are always changing and growing became well-ingrained in my mind. There is definitely more I want to do and add to my site, but I have to constantly remind myself that developing a website is a process. It takes time, and there isn't necessarily a "finished" product.

  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>

      Peer pairing on coding challenges has a long list of benefits. For one, it prepares us novices for real-world work environments in which developers are required to collaborate in teams on varying projects. Even more, at an early stage of learning to code, it is especially helpful in allowing me the opportunity to find clarification on confusing concepts by discussing it with another individual, as well as learn new ways of approaching a problem by seeing that person's thought process when solving an exercise. These sessions put two minds together, meaning we can catch each other's mistakes and utilize methods one of us may not have encountered before. It is not only good practice for working with other individuals but also a pretty amazing way to expand your coding knowledge.

      I was initially nervous about peer pairing in DBC. I thought it might be uncomfortable or awkward, but even worse I was afraid I wouldn't understand a challenge and as a result, not be able to contribute anything meaningful to the session and let my pair down. However, once I started pairing my nerves started dissipating, and I began to feel more comfortable partnering with other students. I think the most difficult part of a pairing session is the beginning, when you're just meeting someone for the first time and trying to get a feel of the other person's pairing style - though it gets better as the session moves along. Everyone I've worked with has been great; they're supportive, patient, and open to listening through my ideas. I've had pairing sessions, where my pair would notice a bug in our code that probably would've taken me awhile to figure out. So, it's great putting our heads together to get through the challenge efficiently and feed off each other's work. I think the most rewarding part of pairing is when we reach a working solution from our code after being stuck for awhile. It feels like such a great success and is awesome to share that accomplishment with someone else.

      The feedback I've received from my pairs has been helpful. It lets me know how I'm doing as a partner; even though I feel more comfortable peer pairing maybe I'm not contributing as positively as I might think or maybe there are things I can do to improve that I wouldn't have noticed myself. One piece of feedback I've received from multiple people is learning more methods from the Ruby Docs prior to a challenge. By doing so, I can find better, more efficient ways of tackling a problem. In addition, I will work on being less timid and more outspoken when expressing my ideas/thoughts, especially if I recognize we're going down the wrong path. Reading the feedback given to me has also helped me write better feedback for my peers. Writing feedback is most difficult when I'm trying to provide constructive feedback. I don't want to offend or hurt anyone's feelings, so its hard for me to formulate my words in the right way. I've just been trying to focus on writing actionable, specific, and kind feedback as suggested by DBC. I've also been trying to make it a habit of writing feedback right after the pairing session, so I can be more specific and jot down my notes while they're fresh.

      It's only Week 5 of Phase 0 at DBC and so far, peer pairing over the web has been a great learning experience and an awesome way of getting to know people in different cohorts before we start our onsite immersive portion of DBC. I'm especially excited about going onsite and pairing with my cohort in person though. I think it'll be even more beneficial when you can speak to the person you're working with face to face with minimal miscommunications and interruptions from moody internet connections or finicky shared coding websites!

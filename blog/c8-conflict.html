  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h2>The one where a server yelled at me.</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      Conflict erupts in our lives spontaneously between friends, family, coworkers, or even strangers. Whether its outburts are small or large, conflict always impacts our emotions. I remember one situation of conflict that occurred when my friends and I visited a popular burger joint in San Diego. This place is always bustling and the line is always out the door. When it was finally our turn to be seated, the waiter said there were open spots at the bar that could fit our group. We agreed and were directed to the bar, where we were surprised to find not enough seats for the whole group. I went back to let the server know and to ask if we could switch to a table that would fit our entire party. The server snapped at me, exclaiming I shouldn't have agreed to sit at the bar to begin with. I was so shocked, I could hardly put together a response. Whatever I muttered didn't matter anyway, since the server just ignored me and walked away.

      In that moment, I felt small, unheard, and disrespected. I felt like the server took advantage of me because I'm a five foot female trying to argue with a male that towered over me. The rest of the meal was ruined by terrible service and by how simply pissed off I was at the server. I do wish I had more courage at the time to tell the server how rude and condescending he was being. Instead, I said nothing, which I think made me more upset. However, looking back at the situation, there could have been a slew of other factors that impacted this server's attitude. Perhaps he was dealing with some personal problems, maybe he was stressed out by the never-ending line of customers he had to serve, or maybe he just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Whatever his deal was, I learned from this experience that I should not take other people's negative actions against me personally. Even more, I should not let them influence my own attitude or drag down my day. After the incident happened, I felt sour for the remainder of the day, but reflecting on it now, I wish I did not let something, which in hindsight was not a huge deal, affect me so dramatically. Conflict may arise in many different, unexpected situations, but we must remember that we can control how we want to approach them and how we let them impact us.

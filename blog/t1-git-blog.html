      	What are the benefits of version control?

      	As a developer, it's important to keep track of the code you're writing. It's easy to get lost in the seemingly endless lines of code in your program as it expands. Enter version control. These systems track all changes in a file, large or small. When you are done making modifications, you can save those changes to a "commit." A commit is titled with a description of the changes, such as "add button." While version control is valuable for independent assignments, it's most useful for team projects because it allows multiple developers to work in the same file without stepping on each other's toes. How? Version control has the capability to merge commits from two or more users into one master document. If anything goes wrong, the team can always revert back to an earlier version with commits. Even more, developers won't need to save multiple versions of their most recent program; any final updates will be merged into one master document.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?

        So, how can you start using version control? There are numerous version control systems available, and one common system is git. Once installed, git lives locally on your computer and is run through your command line. It is designed to view your code with a tree-like structure, meaning the master file containing your program can be thought of as the trunk (or master branch) and commits can be thought of as the smaller branches connected to the trunk. This type of set-up allows multiple developers to work on the same file without interfering with each other's work. Just imagine each branch as its own developer making changes that will be saved to a commit and later merged into the master file, the trunk. Since git lives locally on your computer, you will need to push your commits (or changes) to a remote website, where your code can be shared, viewed, and altered by your team. This stage is where GitHub comes in.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?

        GitHub is a coding website that allows developers to share their code online, as well as keep track of their changes with git. It stores a user's working git directories, also referred to as repositories (or repos). You can push a commit to GitHub so that it can be pulled and reviewed by other developers and eventually merged into the master file (so long as it does not contain any bugs that will cause your program to break). Without GitHub, your changes would sit locally on your computer and could not be readily accessed by other members of your team, which ultimately defeats the purpose of git and version control usage.

    	Recap (aka TLDR)

    	Version Control: tracks all changes in a file and allows multiple users to work on one file without stepping on each other's toes
    	Git: a version control system, which is set up with a tree-like structure (the trunk is the master file containing your program; the branches are the developers making changes that may be merged into the trunk)
    	GitHub: a hub for your git repositories; it creates a path from your local git files to a remote (public) website to be viewed by the rest of your team
